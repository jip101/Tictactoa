# Tictactoe
The goal for this project is to practice closures.
There will be minimal to no global variables created.
The game will be initially created with 1v1 local multiplayer. 
Each player will be able to change their names, otherwise, default will be player 1 and 2.
The next feature will be option to play against a cpu. 
A lofty goal will be to start with an easy difficulty, where cpu plays random spots.
Medium difficulty will be implemented with playing spaces in predefined, tiered order.
Impossible difficulty will be a way to practice BFS and make it impossible to win.
